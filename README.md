Happy coding!

Responsive Web Design -
    Use fluid layout - avoid fixed values so the element is relative to the viewport
    Be carefull of the order of media queries as the last one could overwrite others.
    
Make the div elements 30% of the window size. Now make this change only for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px
    
Set the margin to 10px on all sides for each column for the devices that are wider than or equal to 992px

Keep the full-size width for the devices below the 992px

Remove the left and right margin for the devices below the 992px

Remember to keep in mind the mobile-first approach
